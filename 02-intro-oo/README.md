# Intro to Object Orientation

## SWBATs

* [ ] Define object in programming domain
* [ ] Explain the concept of sending messages
* [ ] Create a class and instantiate an instance of the class
* [ ] Explain the difference between a class and an instance
* [ ] Pass arguments to new by defining an initialize method in class
* [ ] Create instance methods
* [ ] Call methods on the implicit or explicit self
* [ ] Define attribute readers and writers using attr_ macros
* [ ] Get more practice with array compositions (each, map, select/filter)
* [ ] Explain the need for variable scope and why it's important to not utilize global variables

## Notes

- object - identity + state/attributes + behavior
- an instance is an implementation of a class
- class is a blueprint/template for creating instances/objects
- provides attributes and behaviors for instances
- classes are like object factories
- classes on their own can also have attributes/state and behaviors/methods


## Deliverables

Write an implementation of a bank account that meets the following requirements:

* √ can show me all the bank accounts that have been created
* B - can print the balance of the account
* √B - can deposit money into the account
* √B - can withdraw money from the account
* √A - keeps track of the account number
<!-- * A - keeps track of the customer id of the account -->
* √A - balance
* √ make a class method for deposit :D


## Discussion Questions

* What's the difference between a class and an instance?
* What is the difference between a local variable and an instance variable?
* What is `self` in a class method?
* What is `self` in an instance method?
