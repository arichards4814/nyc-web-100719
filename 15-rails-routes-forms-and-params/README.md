* [x] Describe similarities between Sinatra routing & Rails routing
* [x] Create a controller
* [x] Create actions/methods for a RESTful controller
* [x] Create views

* [Action View Form Helpers (using `form_with`)](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html)
    * [form_with (ActionView::Helpers::FormHelper) - APIdock](https://apidock.com/rails/ActionView/Helpers/FormHelper/form_with) - `form_with` is the newer way to build forms in Rails; it can be used with an ActiveRecord model or without to make a generic form
* [Action View Form Helpers (using `form_for`)](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v5.2/form_helpers.html)
    * [form_for (ActionView::Helpers::FormHelper) - APIdock](https://apidock.com/rails/ActionView/Helpers/FormHelper/form_for) - `form_for` is the older way of creating a form in Rails *with* an ActiveRecord model; it has been 'soft deprecated' and will be removed at some point in future versions of Rails
    * [form_tag (ActionView::Helpers::FormHelper) - APIdock](https://apidock.com/rails/ActionView/Helpers/FormTagHelper/form_tag) - `form_tag` is the older way of creating a generic form in Rails *without* an ActiveRecord model; it has been 'soft deprecated' and will be removed at some point in future versions of Rails
* [Strong Params](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html#strong-parameters)

### Rails Commands We Used In Lecture

* `rails new <app-name> -G` - creates a new application without a .git folder
* `rails routes` - prints all the defined routes on the screen
* `rails g migration <migration-name> <field_name:datatype> <field_name:datatype>` - creates a migration with the indicated fields and datatypes
* `rails db:migrate` - run all outstanding migrations (all (or most) of the db commands are the same as we used in ActiveRecord in Mod 1 and Sinatra, e.g. `rails db:migrate:status`, `rails db:rollback`)
